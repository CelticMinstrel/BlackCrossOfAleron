Eärendil
--------
Type: Elvish Druid
ID: chiefdruid
First Appearance: Scenario 1

Unlike some of the older teachers such as Caluclya, she has no particular
specialty yet.

Gruk
----
Type: Goblin Rouser
ID: gruk
First Appearance: Scenario 1
Role: Enemy Leader

An underling of Burluk whose task was subjugating the citadel as quickly

Amuwen
------
Type: Elvish Druid
ID: lastteacher
First Appearance: Scenario 1
Role: Doomed

One of the older teachers at the Druid Citadel of Aleron, Amuwen specializes
in poisons and antidotes. Unfortunately, her leg was broken during the attack
and thus she was unable to defend herself as effectively, ultimately leading
to her death.

Tiolindë
--------
Type: Elvish Shyde
ID: N/A
First Appearance: Never (deceased)
Role: Doomed

The eldest teacher at the Druid Citadel of Aleron and formerly the head of the
institution. She was the first to wake during the attack, and with help from Amuwen
was able to take down a dire wolf, but at the cost of her life and Amuwen's leg.

Eovyniel
--------
Type: Elvish Initiate (with treewalk)
ID: tw_1st
First Appearance: Scenario 1
Role: Hero

One of the middle-tier students at the Druid Citadel of Aleron, and Eärendil's
little sister. She can't bring herself to address Eärendil properly as a
teacher, and Eärendil has long since given up on rebuking her over this.

Erendor
-------
Type: Elvish Ranger
ID: chiefguard
First Appearance: Scenario 1
Role: Hero

The leader of the guards stationed at Aleron Citadel in case of an event just
such as this. Unfortunately, the goblins initially overwhelmed the guards,

Brave Guard

Type: Elvish Fighter
ID: braveguard
First Appearance: Scenario 1

The fighter who performed a sweep to ensure no goblins remained hidden in
any of the dormitories.

ID: herbalist
First Appearance: Scenario 1 (on hard, scenario 10)
Role: Loyal

One of the oldest teachers at the Druid Citadel, Caluclya is an expert in the
use of herbs. As a result, her healing is the best of any elf, and she can
even regenerate a little when in the forest. Caluclya survived the attack
because she was out in the mountains when the goblins struck, hunting for rare
herbs

On easy and normal mode, she returns before the others have left on their quest,
and joins them. However, on hard mode, she stays out longer, and returns to find
the citadel almost abandoned apart from a few remaining initiates who had somehow
missed joining the quest. Naturally she starts putting them to work on cleaning up,
and when more goblins appear, she organizes them into a small resistance force.

Scout
-----
Type: Elvish Scout
ID: advancescout

The scout who Erendor sent across the river to investigate the source of the goblin

dedicated to the task of killing his brother who has gone astray. To deny him that
would anger him greatly.

Sir Malcorn

Role: Enemy Leader

One of the most ambitious of Kaden Kreuz's followers. Malcorn does not remember what
he was in life, but knows exactly where he wants to be in death - at the top. He is not

his rise to power.

Glamethkor is the leader of a group of bandits who live on the north coast of
Sharnough. He's a very tolerant type, and as a result has managed to gather

bulk of his followers. His arch-enemy is Harry Muflin the highwayman.

Kaden Kreuz
-----------
Type: Orcish Necromancer
ID: malinkalar
First Appearance: Scenario 7
Role: Enemy Leader

The younger brother of Graktar, and a necromancer with nebulous goals. He studied
with the shamans for many years, but then disappeared for some time before reuniting
with Graktar, who initially received him with joy; however, after seeing what his
brother had become, Graktar privately swore to destroy him himself.

Kaden didn't talk much about the specifics of his goals, but if you have all the
optional characters, the picture put together from the end cutscene should be that
those goals may not have been bad in themselves; rather, just the methods were bad.

First Appearance: Scenario 10
Role: Enemy (he's set as the leader in the scenario, but an event will always demote him)

the other two. He was the one who located the citadel and lead Malcorn there.
