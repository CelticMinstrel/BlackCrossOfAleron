This is a list of things that are needed on the graphics front, ordered by category and priority.

Portraits
=========

The following unit types need a portrait:
- Elvish Initiate
- Elvish Treewalker
- Elvish Wisp
- Orcish Necromancer

The following characters should have a unique portrait:
- EÃ¤rendil (2 forms, with wings and without)
- Erendor
- Eovyniel (2 forms, with wings and without)
- Ariandela (2 forms, with wings and without)
- Graktar

The following characters could use a unique portrait (low priority):
- Aphrophila (3 forms - initiate, priestess, enchantress)
- Sir Malcorn
- Nel-Brisad
- Caluclya (2 forms, with wings and without)
- Kaden Kreuz (3 forms - orc, spirit, lich)
