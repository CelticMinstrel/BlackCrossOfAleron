This is a list of things that are needed on the graphics front, ordered by category and priority.

Portraits
=========

The following unit types need a portrait:
- Elvish Initiate
- Elvish Treewalker
- Elvish Wisp
- Elvish Mage
- Elvish Archmage
- Elvish Zealot
- Elvish Priestess

Attack Icons
============

- slam (Giant Frog)
- poison fangs (Mother Rat)
- rat tail (Vicious Rat)

The rat variants could use new graphics, but I consider this very low priority. However, a tailwhip animation would be welcome.
