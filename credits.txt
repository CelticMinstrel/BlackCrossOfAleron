This is a list of people to credit, mostly for my reference when I get around to doing it properly.

- Chasm bridge created by lurker from the forums.
- Star-shaped ellipse is from core, but with blue and green channels removed to allow team colouring
- Elvish Civilian was taken from The Settlers of Light, but it's also found in Invasion from the Unknown and After the Storm, so I'm not sure who to credit.
- Ankh and storm trident overlays are from Dead Water
- Dominated overlay adapted from an attack icon by Eleazar
- Other overlays are adapted from mainline icons of various purposes
- New attack icons (for mage/zealot lines) by Eleazar
