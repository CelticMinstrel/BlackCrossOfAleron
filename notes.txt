Ideas
=====
- Only the unit who took the Ring of Domination from the ruined hut can give it to Ariandela
- An option with Ariandela to hint at the Ring of Domination being the key to getting her which is available even when you don't have much gold
- Change potion mechanics so that you select exactly which units get the benefits
- In the swamp, scatter four or so "nests" around the map, and spawn 2-3 giant frogs every time any unit steps on them
- In the swamp, spawn 3 groups each of 3-6 giant mosquitoes at the beginning of every dusk turn
- Add some giant bats and giant mosquitoes to Journey Home at the start of every dusk turn
- Gryphon nest in Journey Home? Step on it, and the gryphon shows up
- Dialogue when you step in the muck in the last scenario
- Goblin spearmen pop out when you seize a tent village

- Custom AI persistence code which doesn't involve carryover gold or including the side in the carryover summary
- Ruined castle on Along the Coast so you can recruit/recall more units partway through

- Watery Tunnels: Make it more obvious how to get back from the Storm Trident cave (place another whirlpool at the other end of the tunnel?)
- More loyal guard orcs?
- Hard mode: Allow less/no archer/fighter recruits?
- Hard mode: Start Erendor as an archer locked into the ranger line?
- Easy mode: Start EÃ¤rendil as a shyde?

- After killing the orc leader in Orc Port, allow the player to end the scenario by stepping on the revealed tunnel.
- Add end dialogue and/or end cutscene and/or end story after final scenario

- Scrap watery tunnels map and redesign from scratch
- Make chasm map a little more palatable for elves, and in particular reduce the bottleneck leading to the lich
- Make the young ogre in Journey Home putter around a bit near its home, staying within a certain radius of it. If it's attacked, maybe make the old ogre no longer a guardian and give him appropriate dialogue.
